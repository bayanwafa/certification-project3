# Quiz Application

Welcome to the Quiz Application! This project is a web application that allows users to play, create, and manage quizzes. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with quizzes and offers features for both players and quiz creators.

## Features

- **Play Quizzes**: Users can choose from a list of available quizzes and play them. The application tracks the user's progress and displays their score at the end of the quiz.

- **Create Quizzes**: Quiz creators can easily create new quizzes by adding questions, options, and specifying the correct answers and points for each question.

- **Manage Quizzes**: Users can manage their quizzes by editing existing quizzes, deleting unwanted quizzes, or creating new ones.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: The frontend of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React Router is used for client-side routing to navigate between different pages. Redux is also utilized for state management, allowing for a more organized and centralized approach to managing application state across components.

- **Backend**: The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful APIs for handling quiz data storage, retrieval, and management. Data is stored in JSON format on the server.

- **Data Persistence**: The application uses asynchronous file operations to read from and write to JSON files on the server, allowing for data persistence between sessions.
